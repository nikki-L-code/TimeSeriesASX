This report focuses on the monthly averages of ASX All Ordinaries (Ords) price index, gold (AUD), crude oil (Brent, USD/bbl), and copper (USD/Tonne) prices from January 2004 to December 2017. The aim of the project is to investigate and analyse the existence of nonstationarity, the impact of the components of the time series data, and to provide the most accurate and suitable distributed lag model for the ASX price index. This will be conducted through descriptive analyses, time series modelling and diagnostic checking.
